# daily-journal-cli

A command line tool for tracking daily activities.

I've recently begun learning Python, and have long understood that the best way to build intimacy with a technology is to use it to build something important to you.

A couple of years ago when refamiliarizing myself with React, I built a small web app that allowed me to quickly record notes on what I did throughout the day. Looking back at these notes is like flipping through old photos.

I've decided to recreate this app as a CLI using Python.
